# Eris
A simple multiplayer game for the Godot Engine 3.X

**Please note: (almost) everything you see in here is under construction**  
**This is a game in development (just like this text), and contributions are welcome :)**


## Yet to be added:
* More power ups: *Fill_Board*, *Block_Color*.
* Animations \o/


## Yet to be fixed:
* Collor Palette, improve UI....
* Network signals.
* Replace Yeld calls for functions called by Timer. (function *object_handling* in *grid.gd*)
* Another things I can't remember right now...


## This project uses:
* [Godot engine 3.4.X](https://godotengine.org/)
* [GDQuest's Grid based movement](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-demos) in 2d as base.
* Songs: "Creepy Comedy" by  Rafael Krux, "Jungle Mission" by  Rafael Krux, "Lurking Sloth" by Alexander Nakarada, and "USSR" by Alexander Nakarada. Tracks available in <https://freepd.com>
